As a developer at Citi, I will integrate risk management into my daily responsibilities by ensuring all code development and system enhancements adhere to Citi's security standards and regulatory compliance requirements. I will identify and mitigate potential risks in the development process by conducting code reviews, implementing secure coding practices, and validating data accuracy in the systems I work on. I will collaborate with my team and other departments to ensure that controls related to our software systems are effectively designed and operational. Additionally, I will actively participate in the Manager’s Control Assessment (MCA), regularly reviewing and testing the integrity of our internal controls. Any issues regarding system vulnerabilities, process inefficiencies, or non-compliance will be promptly escalated and resolved. I will complete all risk and control training on time and remain up-to-date with Citi’s evolving risk management framework.
